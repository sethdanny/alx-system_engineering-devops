## Introduction to Shell Scripting
---
```
The shell is a program that provides the user with an interface to use the operating systemâ€™s functions through some commands. A shell script is a program that is used to perform specific tasks
```
```
Shell scripts are mostly used to avoid repetitive work. You can write a script to automate a set of instructions to be executed one after the other, instead of typing in the commands one after the other n number of time
```
### A typical script might look like this:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Welcome!! Please Enter Your Name"
read name
echo "Hello $name"
```
